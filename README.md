# calculator
calcutor by qt 
The calculator is finished by c++ with qt and I use visual studio to do the work.
The calculator can perform basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and clear functions. Besides, I also added the ability to delete and minus.
The calculator can work with only 2 numbers and complex calculations with multiple numbers are impossible. You can only do further operations after you have calculated a result, namely "=".
